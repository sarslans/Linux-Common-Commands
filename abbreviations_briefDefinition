*******SSL Certification*********
SSL - Secure Socket Layer
SSL Certification contains a Public Key, a Private Key. 
Private key with the code and Public key used to decote it.
The private key is installed on the server and never shared with anyone.The Public key 
is incorporated into the SSL certificate and shared with web browsers.

 ******* SSL / TLS / HTTPS ************************

SSL (Secure Socket Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security) works on top of the transport layer.

HTTP is an application layer protocol.

In regular, non-encrypted HTTP, the protocol stack can look like this:

    HTTP
    TCP
    IP
    Ethernet

When using HTTPS, the stack looks like this:

    HTTP
    TLS (SSL)
    TCP
    IP
    Ethernet

HTTPS runs over SSL (as it's name suggests, HTTP-over-SSL), not SSL over HTTP. First SSL session is established, 
then all HTTP data are wrapped into secured SSL packets before sending and after receiving.
